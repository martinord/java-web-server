# [TCP Web Server](http://github.com/martinord/java-web-server)

This is a simple Web Server implemented in Java, corrected from a coursework during my studies.<br>
It is implemented as a multithread server, serving the files using TCP sockers, analyzing the requests and giving the correspondent replies. It is also implementing access and errors log.


## Quick Start

Build the project or download the JAR from Releases. To run it: <br>
```bash
java -jar JavaWebServer-0.1.jar
```

It is needed in the same folder to have a folder named `config` and a file called `settings.conf`. You can find an example of this file [here](https://github.com/martinord/java-web-server/tree/master/config).
